        h4 Hub Candidates:
        p After being selected as a Hub Candidate, each individual Hub will begin the process of accreditation with the Savory Institute. The process will include specific requirements that are both time sensitive and required for achieving accreditation. Here is a list of the current requirements:
        ol
          li <strong>Business Plan.</strong> Every Hub will be required to submit a final business plan providing the specifics of implementation relevant to the existing region. This implementation will involve managing the local demonstration site, offering training and consulting services, and providing monitoring and data management services for site management. 
        
          li <strong>Demonstration site.</strong> Maintain management influence or control of a local demonstration site for the purpose of education, training and research. This site must be managed using Holistic Management. The site must use the core Holistic Management planning procedures for operating. Each Hub will use the local site for providing workshops and demonstrations on how the practice of HM works on site. The actual planning procedures and baseline monitoring must be on file before the organization can be recognized as an accredited Hub. The Hub demonstration site may be audited to confirm compliance of the requirements.
         
          li <strong>SI accredited professionals.</strong> To maintain quality and consistency amongst the Hub network and special projects, SI requires that all Hubs use SI accredited professionals in training and consulting. Each Hub will have access to the network of accredited professionals to provide these services. Each Hub can hire accredited professionals as staff or provide staff to be accredited by SI or another accredited Hub. Holistic Management Training will be provided to Hubs interested in having accredited professionals on staff. 
        
          li <strong>Hub Leadership Bootcamp.</strong> Two leaders from each Hub will be required to attend the Hub Leadership Bootcamp. The typical format would include 8-10 days of training addressing organizational development, brand and marketing support, networking, Holistic Management overview as well as field training and support. The training will be facilitated by SI staff including a few sessions with Allan Savory. 
        
          li <strong>Funding.</strong> Based upon the business plan submitted, each Hub will need to raise the financial resources needed for execution. Those resources will need to be confirmed before official accreditation. The Savory Institute will provide assistance in fundraising for grants and investments. SI encourages each candidate to seek out the necessary funding for implementation of the business plan. SI cannot guarantee funding will be available to existing candidates.
        
          li <strong>Fees & expenses.</strong> Each Hub is required to provide funding for the fees and expenses of the following activities. In the past, SI has been able to contribute donor funds to cover the majority of expenses associated with the Leadership Bootcamp. Future funding is not guaranteed. Deposit is absolutely required.
            ul
              li <strong>Deposit:</strong> $5,000 
              li <strong>Leadership Bootcamp.</strong> This deposit covers expenses of the Hub Leadership Bootcamp (2 people for 8-10 days) which includes food, accommodations and travel within Zimbabwe. International travel to Zimbabwe is not included. 
              li <strong>Holistic Management Training.</strong> Each Hub will make the decision if they need an Accredited Professional as a member of the Hub core team. If needed, SI will provide a specific training in the first quarter of 2015. This training will be a total of 8 days. The cost is $2,000 and can include 2 people. If an existing team member is already an Accredited Professional this is not needed. 
        
        h3 Technology Platform
        p Savory’s technology platform has been developed to provide online support and training for farmers, professionals and land managers. This platform provides specific tools that enhance one’s understanding of Holistic Management as well as assisting in the implementation. Our focus areas are online education, data management and collaboration.  
        
        h3 Online Education
        p Our platform handles all aspects of the educational process. We’re using a state of the art, open platform, Canvas Learning Management System, to deliver world-class media-rich content. 
        p Our program is far from the traditional self or business-improvement material you may have come across in the past. The Savory Institute will help you describe your context for achieving objectives while integrating each individual’s cultural, material and spiritual needs with their life-supporting environment. Holistic Management is about proactively managing this type of complexity and making sure that managers have all the tools to address cash flow and profit, environmental vigor, and social factors as one inseparable whole when making decisions. It addresses the key component of timing and how to create feedback loops to test new actions to ensure that the highest level of performance is realized. The Savory Institute’s new generation of curriculum provides you with the education and means to find a competitive edge to flourish on all fronts of your life. It's about fine-tuning the machine, like a performance sports car, to learn the leverage points to maximize productivity towards your goals. 
        
        h3 Data Management
        p Launching in April of 2015, our data management platform allows for land managers to create and manage the farm using Holistic Management. In addition, it allows for the collection of ecological data to monitor changes and progress on the land. Here are some of the features:
        ul
          li Integrated with Holistic Management planning and materials
          li Land mapping
          li Data Collecting for ecological and animal performance indicators
        
        h3 Collaboration Forum
        p We are in the development of a forum that allows for the global collaboration of farmers, professionals and Hubs. This forum will incorporate the sharing of resources, ideas, challenges, successes as well as the opportunity to facilitate meaningful conversations that enable long-term success on the land. We expect the forum to launch in the third quarter of 2015.
