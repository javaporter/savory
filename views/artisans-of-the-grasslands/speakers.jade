        h2 Allan Savory
        p Allan was born in Rhodesia, southern Africa. He pursued an early career as a research biologist and Game Ranger in the British Colonial Service of what was then Northern Rhodesia (today Zambia), and later as a farmer, game rancher, politician and international consultant, based in Southern Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe). In the 1960's, while working on the interrelated problems of increasing poverty and disappearing wildlife, he made a significant breakthrough in understanding what was causing the degradation and desertification of the world’s grassland ecosystems. He went on to work, as a resource management consultant, with numerous managers, eventually on four continents, to develop sustainable solutions.
        p His early results in reversing land degradation in a manner that made, rather than cost, money were impressive. But, as he often states, his failures were equally impressive! Finally, in the mid 1980’s the last of some key missing pieces fell into place. Since then thousands of land, livestock and wildlife managers have been able to demonstrate consistent results following the methodology he called “holistic management.”
        p Savory served as a Member of Parliament in the latter days of Zimbabwe’s civil war and leader of the opposition to the ruling party headed by Ian Smith. Exiled in 1979, as a result of his opposition, he emigrated to the United States where he co­founded the non­profit organization Holistic Management International with his wife, Jody Butterfield. In 1992 they formed a second non­profit (social welfare) organization near Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, the Africa Centre for Holistic Management, donating a ranch that would serve as a learning site for people all over Africa. Savory and the five local Chiefs are permanent Trustees of the Africa Centre. Savory and his wife divide their time between Zimbabwe and New Mexico.
        p In 2003, Savory was awarded the Banksia International Award for the person or organization doing the most for the environment on a global scale. His current work in Africa is receiving much praise and recognition and the Africa Centre for Holistic Management was announced the winner of the 2010 Buckminster Fuller Award for the organization working to solve the world’s most pressing problems.

        h2 Colin Seis
        p The Seis family is one of the early pioneering families in the Gulgong district of New South Wales Australia, and has been farming and grazing sheep in the area since the 1860s.
        p Colin Seis owns the 2000 acre property “Winona” which is situated North of Gulgong in the central tablelands of New South Wales.  The property runs around four thousand, fine wool merino sheep, and grows around 500 acres annually to oats, wheat and cereal rye using the ‘pasture cropping’ technique that Colin developed over 20 years ago. Another important enterprise on Winona is native grass seed which is harvested from the property’s native grassland.
        p Winona also runs one of the largest kelpie, working dog, studs in the world and sells dogs and pups to many countries in North and South America, Europe and Scandinavia as well as all states of Australia.
        p Colin has a published book on training working dogs (“Working Dogs”), which is sold internationally.  He has also conducted dog training clinics internationally in the USA, Norway and Sweden and in most states of Australia.
        p Colin is best known for the development of a practice known as ‘Pasture Cropping’. Created in 1993 by Colin, it is a technique of zero till sowing an annual crop into perennial pastures. ‘Pasture Cropping’ will not only produce high yielding crops but has been proven to restore landscape ecological health, restore native grasslands, increase native grass recruitment in quantity and diversity , improve grazing pasture quality and sequester large amounts of soil carbon.
        p In an era of growing human population it has the potential to feed the increasing human population while restoring grassland ecosystems, and soil health.
        p This revolutionary method of growing crops goes far beyond short-term crop yields.  It contributes to the development of vitally needed topsoil, water management, stabilizing the many forms of soil erosion, controlling weeds, increasing pasture plant numbers and diversity as well as great potential for restoring grasslands, increasing soil carbon levels , improving soil health and growing nutrient dense, healthy food.
        p By retaining perennial grass in grazing and cropping systems and having 100% ground cover
        p 100% of the time, large increase in plant biomass can be achieved when compared to traditional farming methods. This biomass, when combined with plant root exudates and soil microbes, has been shown to dramatically increase soil carbon levels and improve the soil food web.
        p On “Winona” soil carbon levels have increased by over 200% during a 10 - year period.
        p Independent studies at Winona on have found that “pasture cropping” is 20% more profitable than conventional agricultural practices, this is coupled with great environment and ecological benefits that will improve the soil and regenerate landscapes.

        p Colin thought that his original concept could be further improved to enhance ecological function, soil health, and soil carbon, reduce insect attack, and reduce pesticide and fertiliser use on farms around the world. Colin developed ‘multi species pasture cropping’ in 2011 by using a group of up to 10 annual plant species that produce good quality forage, have a range of different root systems, includes, legume species, flowing plants and species that will add organic matter on the soil surface, and in the soil, as root mass. The species mix can also include vegetables. These species are sown into grassland or perennial pastures using the ‘pasture cropping’ technique, which will enhance the grassland, not destroy it.

        p ‘Multi species pasture cropping’ has been shown to:
        ul
          li Restore grasslands
          li Produce low cost, nutrient dense vegetables for human consumption.
          li Produced superior quality stock forage.
          li Improve soil health, soil carbon, structure, and water infiltration.
          li Reduced or no pesticides. (can be an organic system)
          li Reduced fertiliser inputs
          li More beneficial insects, (no insect attack)
          li After grazing the multi species crop, of oats or wheat can be harvested for grain.

        p Monoculture grain production around the world, with high pesticide use and soil destroying technology can no longer be afforded ecologically. ‘Multi species pasture cropping’ address the ecological problems associated with present day agricultural practices and produces food for the growing human population while restoring ecological function to farms worldwide.

        p In addition to owning and managing Winona, Colin’s dedication to farmer education, support programmes and generosity in enabling extensive scientific study and evaluation of his practices has resulted in ‘Pasture Cropping’ being adopted around the world and an estimated three million acres are being sown using the regenerative technique in Australia, USA, South Africa, South America Europe and Scandinavia to grow crops and restore grasslands and soil. Because of this there are now well over 3000 farmers worldwide, managing an estimated three million acres, using the technique.
        p During the development of ‘pasture cropping’ and improved land management techniques Colin has been awarded many times for his achievements. Some of these awards include:
        p The Australian Conservation Farmer of the year in 2005.  The National Carbon Farmer of the Year in 2007. The Australian Green Agriculture and Innovation award 2012 (GAIA), which is awarded for leading contributions to soil health and sequestration of Carbon and Colin’s most recent award in September 2014 was winning Australia’s most prestigious farming and environmental award, the National Bob Hawke Landcare award.

        h2 Fred Provenza
        p Fred Provenza is professor emeritus of Behavioral Ecology with the Department of Wildland Resources at Utah State University.  He is a pioneer in the study of how behavior links soils, plants, herbivores, and humans and their collective effects on landscapes. The many awards he received for research, teaching, and mentoring represent the productivity that flowed from warm professional and personal relationships with over 75 graduate students, post-doctoral students, visiting scientists, and colleagues he worked with during the past 40 years.
        p For the past 40 years, Fred’s team has produced research that laid the foundation for what is now known as behavior-based management of livestock and wildlife. That work has inspired researchers in disciplines as diverse as animal behavior, animal welfare, wildlife damage science and management, veterinary science, ruminant nutrition, human nutrition and biopsychology, chemical ecology, plant ecology and horticulture, landscape restoration ecology, and pasture and rangeland science and management. Along with colleagues and students, he has authored or co-authored over 250 publications in scientific journals and books. He has been an invited speaker at over 400 conferences. His latest book, co-authored with Michel Meuret, is The Art & Science of Shepherding: Tapping the Wisdom of French Herders.
        p These efforts led to the formation in 2001 of an international network of scientists and land managers from five continents. That consortium, known as BEHAVE (Behavioral  Education for Human, Animal, Vegetation and Ecosystem Management), is committed to integrating behavioral principles and processes with local knowledge to  enhance ecological, economic and social values of rural and urban communities. They seek to inspire and enable people to understand and use knowledge of behavior, ours and other creatures, to create environmentally friendly relationships that reconcile differences of opinion about how to manage landscapes. In this process, everyone involved is a student attempting to better understand behavior at all levels from genes to landscapes. We use understanding of behavior to help people learn to appreciate that our differences are our strength in sustaining communities and landscapes by integrating diverse ecological, economic and social values and services.

        h2 Jody Butterfield
        p Jody Butterfield is a Savory Institute co-founder and the Director of Special Projects. She has worked over the last 30 years to communicate the story of Holistic Management, initially as a freelance writer and then as a collaborator with husband Allan Savory on books, articles and papers, including the basic texts still in use today – Holistic Management: A New Decision Making Framework (1999) and the Holistic Management Handbook: Healthy Land, Healthy Profits (2006). In 1984 she co-founded, with Allan, the Center for Holistic Management (later renamed Holistic Management International) and over the following two decades served in a variety of positions, including Publications Director, Training Programs Director, and Research Coordinator. In 1992 she and Allan co-founded the Africa Centre for Holistic Management in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.

        p Shortly after the launch of the Savory Institute in 2009, Jody landed the opportunity to fulfill a decades’ long dream to bring holistic management to pastoral communities in Africa with a multi-year grant from the US Agency for International Development. Working with the dedicated staff of the Africa Centre for Holistic Management (ACHM) and training professionals, she developed methods and materials for introducing communities to Holistic Land & Livestock Management – a curriculum specific to communal land situations where livestock are herded. ACHM has since trained over 100 community facilitators from Southern Africa who are proving increasingly successful at empowering communities to restore their land through Holistic Planned Grazing. In 2014, in collaboration with her Savory Institute colleagues, Jody adapted the Holistic Land & Livestock Management curriculum for online presentation to the worldwide Savory Hub community.

        p In 2015 she took on the role of Special Projects Director, working with partnering organizations to build capacity and proof of concept in key strategic regions where the power of Holistic Management has not yet been demonstrated.

        p Jody was born in Salt Lake City, Utah. She received a BA in Journalism and an MA in American Studies from the University of Utah following a year of classwork, writing and lecturing at the Polytechnic of Central London. From 1975–1983 she worked as a freelance writer, editor and photographer, based in The Netherlands, Washington, DC, and Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she met Allan in 1979.

        p Seth Itzkan is an environmental futurist. Since 2008, he has focused on investigating and promoting innovative means of land management that offer hope for reversing global warming. His primary interest is the carbon drawdown potential of restored grasslands and the role of livestock in kickstarting soil recovery, with the greater goal of incorporating Holistic Management into society’s climate narrative.

        p Over a three-year period, Seth spent a total 16 weeks at the Africa Center for Holistic Management (ACHM) in Zimbabwe, traveling with herders, interviewing village practitioners, and working alongside ACHM staff. His 2012 TEDx talk, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOpoRdpvlh0">Reversing Global Warming with Livestock?</a>, a firsthand account of witnessing the ecological fruits of regenerative grazing, helped set the stage for Allan Savory’s seminal 2013 <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world_s_deserts_and_reverse_climate_change?language=en">TED talk</a>.

Will graduated in 1976 and returned to Bluffton where he and his father continued to raise cattle using pesticides, herbicides, hormones and antibiotics. They also fed their herd a high-carbohydrate diet of corn and soy.

        p These tools did a fantastic job of taking the cost out of the system, but in the mid-1990’s Will became disenchanted with the excesses of these industrialized methods. They had created a monoculture for their cattle, and, as Will says, “nature abhors a monoculture.” In 1995, Will made the audacious decision to return to the farming methods his great-grandfather had used 130 years before.

With a longstanding passion for alternative agricultural models, Chris has dedicated much of his life to helping connect ranchers with consumers in ways that create real value for both parties.

        p For 6 years Chris co-managed a 2,000 acre diversified farm based on holistic planned grazing and permaculture in the Sacramento Valley. The farm is comprised of old growth olive orchards, heirloom stonefruits and citrus groves, and also raises grassfed cattle, sheep, goats, and pasture-raised chickens for both meat and eggs. The farm attracted national notoriety and the attention from public figures such as Joel Salatin and Michael Pollan. Chris has also played a role as a leader in the emerging agri-tourism market and he facilitated a partnership with a European-based hospitality company and the farm he managed. The resulting farmstays provided urban dwellers a recreational, but also educational, outlet to see first-hand how food could be produced in abundance outside the realm of conventional industrial systems.

        p Chris has become a recognized public speaker championing for stronger connections between grower and eater and providing training to help build those connections. He has been on the forefront of the collaborative process with state and federal regulators, advocating for the acknowledgment of alternative safe agricultural models in addition to the consumers' right to access healthy local foods. Chris is also very enthusiastic about developing opportunities for young ranchers. Fostering creative solutions to removing barriers of available land and capital will ultimately help cultivate the next generation of holistic land stewards.
