        h1 Savory Platform
        p Our learning platform handles all aspects of the educational process. We’re using a state of the art, open platform, Canvas Learning Management System, to deliver world-class media-rich content. Their intuitive interface also handles registration, course administration, analysis of skill mastery and progress tracking.
        p Our program is far from the traditional self or business-improvement material you may have come across in the past. The Savory Institute will help you describe your context for achieving objectives while integrating each individual’s cultural, material and spiritual needs with their life-supporting environment. Holistic Management is about proactively managing this type of complexity and making sure that managers have all the tools to address cash flow and profit, environmental vigor, and social factors as one inseparable whole when making decisions. It addresses the key component of timing and how to create feedback loops to test new actions to ensure that the highest level of performance is realized. The Savory Institute’s new generation of curriculum provides you with the education and means to find a competitive edge to flourish on all fronts of your life. It's about fine-tuning the machine, like a performance sports car, to learn the leverage points to maximize productivity towards your goals.

        p Thanks to the generous support of the V.K. Rasmussen Foundation, Savory is proud to announce its refined and updated curriculum.
        p To start you off on the road to managing holistically, we have created five online, multi-media, and self-paced courses that will provide you with the solid foundation to excel in our face-to-face workshops in the future or deepen your understanding of Holistic Management if you have already taken these courses in the past.
        p The online courses include the first three of six units (the remaining units are currently taught through face-to-face, hands-on workshops). These foundational courses will prepare you for taking our face-to-face workshops where you will have the opportunity to learn the skills to master the implementation of the processes unique to Holistic Management:

          li Holistic Planned Grazing
          li Holistic Land Planning
          li Holistic Ecological Monitoring

        h3 Each course will have various components:
