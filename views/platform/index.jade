        p Our e-learning platform handles all aspects of the educational process. We use a state-of-the-art, open platform which handles registration, course administration, and progress tracking through each course. Our program is far from the traditional material you may have come across in the past.

        p Thanks to the generous support of the V.K. Rasmussen Foundation, Savory is proud to announce its refined and updated curriculum.
        p To start you off on the road to managing holistically, we have created five online, multi-media, and self-paced courses that will provide you with the solid foundation to excel in our face-to-face workshops in the future or deepen your understanding of Holistic Management if you have already taken these courses in the past.
        p The online courses include the first three of six units (the remaining units are currently taught through face-to-face, hands-on workshops). These foundational courses will prepare you for taking our face-to-face workshops where you will have the opportunity to learn the skills to master the implementation of the processes unique to Holistic Management:
        ul.plus
          li Building Wealth Through Holistic Financial Planning
          li Holistic Planned Grazing
          li Holistic Land Planning
          li Holistic Ecological Monitoring

        p All our courses are intended to be learned sequentially (Course 1 before Course 2) and build upon requisite knowledge aquired in the previous course.

        h3 Each course will have various components:
