          p Our strategy is three-fold: We demonstrate our results in diverse contexts; we equip and empower people and share our experiences in learning and achieving success; and we pave the way for a global movement to take off, being an advocate and catalyst of needed change.

        h3 Demonstrate Success
        p In partnerships with aligned organizations, with the intention of building capacity and proof of concept in key strategic regions, we demonstrate the power of Holistic Management through Special Projects. Currently, we have special projects in the USA, New Zealand, and China, and are beginning work in new regions in 2015. Among our strategic partners we can mention Grasslands LLC, The Nature Conservancy, and Heifer International.

          p Through a global network of entrepreneurial innovators and leaders committed to serving their regions with the highest standards of Holistic Management training and implementation support, and incubating contextually relevant, holistic solutions to accelerate the needed shifts in decision making and resource management. In the past 3 years, 30 Hubs have been established and nurtured, and we plan to welcome many more in the years to come.

        h4 Informing Policy and Programs
        p Policies and development programs concerning grasslands and livestock management in many countries are often flawed – and they are a major reason why desertification is expanding so rapidly around the world. The Savory Institute informs policymakers and stakeholders of the need to shift current agriculture and land management policies and programs.

        h4 Identifying and Establishing Market Incentives
        p The Savory Institute works to identify and establish strategies to create market-based incentives to encourage managing holistically to create environmental, economic and social benefits. 

        h4 Monitoring, Curating, and Coordinating Research
        p The Savory Institute coordinates and supports comprehensive social, ecological, and financial monitoring and relevant research. We work in collaboration with organizations, scientists, and academic institutions to collect and conduct research that will increase our understanding of how properly managed livestock in the grasslands of the world and managing holistically contribute to increasing biological diversity, increasing soil carbon, and addressing problems such as drought, poverty, hunger, and social violence.

        h4 Increasing Public Awareness
        p The Savory Institute engages many different audiences to change public perception that livestock itself causes the degradation of grasslands. It is actually the way humans manage livestock that is the culprit. This fundamental shift in thinking must happen to drive needed policy and market shifts. Many different key environmental activists and thought leaders are supporting our efforts to increase public awareness such as TED, HRH Prince of Wales, Deepak Chopra, Ian Somerhalder, Hazel Henderson, Gretel Erlich, and Peter Byck among others.

                h2.section-title History
                p In the 1960s Zimbabwean wildlife biologist-farmer Allan Savory made a significant breakthrough in understanding what was causing the degradation and desertification of the world’s grassland ecosystems and developed a way to restore the land to health using livestock as his primary tool.
          .row
            .small-12.columns
              p For centuries we believed livestock were a major cause of desertification, but Savory’s research showed that the cause lay in how those livestock were managed. His solution involved mimicking the behavior of the formerly vast herds of wild grazing animals he had witnessed as a young biologist. He devised a simple method any pastoralist can use to move massive amounts of carbon and water from the atmosphere back to the soil and begin reversing thousands of years of human-caused desertification – on the scale required, which no technology imaginable can accomplish. In the process, we can feed more people and enhance societal well-being.
