To sign the first universal and legally binding climate agreement to reduce emissions in an effort to keep a livable climate on Earth.

        p Although reducing emissions is imperative, it is not enough. Excess atmospheric carbon needs to be drawn down from the atmosphere and safely stored where it belongs: the SOIL.
