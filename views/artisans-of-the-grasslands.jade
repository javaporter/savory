        p This unprecedented event will be a venue for producers and consumers to come together and celebrate the cadre of people embracing the holistic paradigm shift in ecology, health, and diet. Join us, along with all thirty Savory Institute Hubs and everyone from gauchos, to Massai, to cowboys — all of whom are actively engaged in this movement. These artisans, who have built their livelihood on fostering an intimate relationship with the land, will commune with passionate families striving to feed their children clean, healthy food that helps rejuvenate the environment on which we all depend.
        blockquote Grasslands are being healed all over the world as pastoralists of all races, genders, religions, and ages band together in a unified effort to regenerate the land and paint a brighter future for all humanity. Holistic Management practitioners use existing resources to sculpt degraded terrain and transform it into thriving working landscapes.
        h3 A new era of food production and healthy living is upon us
        p We've seen a new awakening among people to embrace living in harmony with their environment — making healthier food choices, and staying active. As we blaze forward, our next step is to engage urbanites. As the incredible poet Wendell Berry was quoted, “Eating is an agricultural act,” and we must meet people where they are — their daily food choices.
