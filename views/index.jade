        h2 Savory: Promoting the Restoration of Grasslands
        p It's our mission to promote the large-scale restoration of the world's grasslands through Holistic Management. Grasslands aren't just important to ranchers, but have a wide-ranging effect on the greater community. Agriculture is the foundation of civilization and any stable economy. Our grasslands can be the genesis of an incredibly strong economy, more self-sufficient communties, and the basis of miraculously renewable food production.

                  p Wild claims are easy; we're backing up our process by utilizing the power of Holistic Management through various international special projects in a wide variety of climate and terrain. Among our strategic partners we can mention Grasslands LLC, The Nature Conservancy, and Heifer International.
                  p We are at a tipping point and feel excited about our burgeoning global network leading transformation in their regions. We're creating sustainable solutions to the pressing problems tied to a failing agriculture, desertification, and climate change.
